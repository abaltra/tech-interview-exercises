/*
Given a file containing n words, given a word w and a number k. Find the k words that precede the word w.

ex:
aaa,
bbb,
ccc,
booking,
alpha,
beta,
gamma

for k = 3 and w = booking, the result is aaa, bbb, ccc, booking
for k = 2 and w = beta, the result is booking, alpha, beta

Try to keep the space complexity under O(n)
